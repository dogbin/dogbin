# dogbin - the sexiest pastebin and url shortener ever! Woof!

Sharing code and logs is all cool, but it should be *easy*! That's where a pastebin
like dogbin comes into play!

## Basic Usage

Type what you want me to see, click the "Save" button, and then copy the URL. Send that
URL to someone and they'll see what you see.

To make a new entry, click the "New" button (or type 'control + n')

### URL shortening

To shorten an URL to a fancy, short del.dog URL, just enter the URL, click on the "Save"
button and then copy the URL. Any future calls to that URL will redirect to what you entered
earlier.

## Duration

Pastes currently have no expiration time, but they may be removed at any time
without notice.

## Privacy

There should be no great expectation of privacy. Post things at your own risk.
Not responsible for any loss of data or removed pastes. Posts are possibly indexed
by search engines.

## Open Source

dogbin can easily be installed behind your network, and it's all [open source](https://github.com/deletescape/dogbin-server)!
